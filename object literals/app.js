// 1. Create a javascript object that represents a food store product.
// The item should contain a name, description, bulk price, and consumer price. 
// console.log the result

// 2. Create a single method for printing the above object's name and description.


// 3. Create another method on the object from step 1 that returns a product's price with a discount applied.
// Supposing the product's price is 5, calling the discount method with a discount of 15% (0.15) will return 4.25.

// 4. Use a for-in loop to print out each property of the object literal (requires research from you :) )
